He's a classic bully -- a blowhard in the abstract, a coward in concrete cases (such as the meeting with the Mexican president.) Republicans and conservatives who detested him a year ago have embraced him now because they think he will sign anything they send him; and he will, for a while at least, because he doesn't really believe in anything or care about any of it. However, I take your point; his supporters appear oblivious to his defects of character, personality and judgment; Trump's genius, if he has any, is he recognizes that and plays them for fools.
I reluctantly credit Trump with emasculating Romney. He invited Romney to dinner and served 'Testicules de Romney'."

What can be said about this ignorant woman... & the fact that she is using 'Indigenous' as a slick byline in order to spew her maladroit, racist garbage which can not get any more pathetic than her 'Look at me -- Look at me' superiority complex?

How this chick is being taken seriously* is simply beyond the pale.

There are many Indigenous Canadian Citizens who do not buy into this phony use of them to promote the 'Reba/Usery-Like-Agenda' of this ever-so-holy woman with the foul mouth.

Regardless of how the discussion of 'Cdn Indigenous Peoples' has been framed by the 'empty barrel' selfie-eager PM, JT, a great preponderance of the Cdn People love our Indigenous Cdns... Always."

About the only thing that Christy gave BC was $50b more in accrued debt; a BC record, and done in less than 6 short years.
